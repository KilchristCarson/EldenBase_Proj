"# EldenBase_Proj" 
EldenBase is a custom database editor for Elden Ring that allows users to modify item stats and names within the application. It connects to a structured database, providing an interactive way to adjust weapon attributes, armor values, consumable effects, and more. However, this tool does not modify the actual game files or in-game dataâ€”changes are only reflected within the application itself.

Project Roles
This was a group project where I was primarily responsible for the Java application code, including implementing the UI, database connectivity, and logic for modifying item attributes. The SQL database design and management were handled by other team members, though I have a strong understanding of that aspect as well. This was a final project from my Spring 2024 class, with some of the design choices being made due to certain restrictions I had to maintain.
